# Unreal Engine 4 Sandbox
This game is planned on being a 3D, SpaceStation13-like game.

## What it currently has
- 3rd-player template map
- Automatic door
- ID cards
- Network play

## Demos
- 2015-05-23: https://youtu.be/ZA6R1K9vfbM

## Building
Mostly, building is done inside the UnrealEngineEditor itself. But, you can
compile the code out of the Editor and have it automatically hot-load.

### Mac OS X
- Checkout project
- Open uproject
- File -> Refresh Xcode Project
- 3 ways to compile
    - Compile button from editor
    - Build target from Xcode
    - Build target using xcodebuild (placed in simple Makefile, for your
    convenience)
